[ColorSwitch](http://appstore.com/zacharyelia/colorswitch) is an iOS app written in Swift released in 2014. It is a fast-paced brain teaser based off of the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). Since its release, it has amassed over **150,000** downloads from countries around the world.

> In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of cognitive interference where a delay in the reaction time of a task occurs due to a mismatch in stimuli.

ColorSwitch gamifies this effect by challenges the user by presenting a color as a word but having it colored in a different color. For example, the word "Blue" is printed in a green color. The user needs to select the blue tile instead of the green tile.
